Reputation Saver will allow you to manage your online reputation by catching the bad reviews and feedback before it hits your social platforms.

== Description ==

**Reputation Saver** Lite is a reputation management software that allows you to capture an unhappy customer that is trying to leave a bad review on your social platforms. This plugin gives you the chance to manage your internet reputation and keep your business healthy. If a customer clicks on the 5 star review, Reputation Saver will prompt the visitor to choose from a platform where they would like to leave a review. They can choose from **Google+**, **Facebook**, **Yelp**, **BBB**, and **Yellowpages** and it will take the visitor straight to your social profile to leave a review. If they choose from 1-4 stars, the user will be promoted with a contact form to contact you instead of leaving a review that could hurt your review rating and your business. Save your online reputation with [Reputation Saver](http://www.reputationsaver.io/). 

= Pro Version Coming Soon =
